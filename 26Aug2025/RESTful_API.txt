# TYPES OF ARCHITECTURE IN REST API

1-tier
2-tier
3-tier

# BENEFITS OF REST API

1. scalability
2. readable
3. security
4. stateless


# GraphQL

Query language for APIs
givers power to clients to access what they exactly need
(there is no need to fetch all the APIs, better and faster request response)


// PROBLEM STAEMENT 1 --> get all data in a single call


normally in REST API-->    continents -> countries -> language
in GraphQL -->

    continents,
    countries,
    languages
}
single call --> get all data
